# Video Preview

#### Objectives

- Practice using `onmouseover` and `onmouseout`
- Practice working from an existing code base

For this assignment we'll be working with some existing code (download here) to add a video in. We'll want to find a free video that we want to work with from [https://www.pexels.com/videos/]. Next, we'll want to add the video into a video tag in the **HTML**. To make the website more interactive add hover events to play and pause the video when hovering.

### Hints:
We may need to make use of the `.play()` and `.pause()` methods - reference [https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/dom_obj_video.asp]

We may also need the video to be `muted` as modern browsers want users to interact with (click) videos for them to start playing.

<hr/>


- [x] Add a <video> into the existing project

- [x] When hovering the video it should preview the content by playing the video on mute

<hr/>

Here is an example of mine. You'll need to download the repository to see the video in action.
